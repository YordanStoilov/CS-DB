-- Create a procedure with the name usp_DeleteEmployeesFromDepartment (@departmentId INT) 
-- which deletes all Employees from a given department. Delete these departments from 
-- the Departments table too. Finally, SELECT the number of employees from the given 
-- department. If the delete statements are correct the select query should return 0.
-- After completing that exercise restore your database to revert all changes.
-- Hint:
-- You may set ManagerID column in Departments table to nullable 
-- (using query "ALTER TABLE â€¦").
